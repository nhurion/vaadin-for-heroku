/**
 * Based on example found in https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm/tree/master/examples/java-webbit-websockets-selenium
 *
 * Example of a WebDriver implementation that has an underlying instance that is used for all scenarios and closed
 * when the JVM exits. This saves time. To prevent browser state from leaking between scenarios, cookies are deleted before
 * every scenario.
 * <p/>
 * As a bonus, screenshots are embedded into the report for each scenario. (This only works
 * if you're also using the HTML formatter).
 * <p/>
 * This class can be shared across step definitions via dependency injection.
